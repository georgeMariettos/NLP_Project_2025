Today is the Dragon Boat Festival, and in Chinese culture, we celebrate it with everything safe and good in our lives.
I hope you enjoy this as much as I do, as is my deepest wish.
Thank you for the message that you showed our words to the doctor, as his next contractual check-up, for all of us.
I received this message so I could see the approved report.
Actually, I got a message from the Professor to show me this a few days ago.
I greatly appreciate the full support of the professor for our publication in Springer Proceedings
