During our last discussion, I told him about the new submission we'd been waiting for since last fall, but the updates were confusing because they didn't include full feedback from the reviewers or maybe the editor?
Anyway, I trust that the team, even if a little late and less communicative in the last few days, has really tried its best in terms of paper and cooperation.
I think we should be grateful, I mean all of us, for accepting and trying until finally last week, the Springer connection.
Also, please remind me if the doctor still intends to edit the acknowledgements section before sending it again.
Since I haven't seen the final part yet, or perhaps I've missed it, I'm sorry if I did.
All in all, let's make sure everyone is safe and celebrate the outcome with strong coffee and future endeavors
